# Duels
Dero asset duels.

Written in Go and using [Fyne Toolkit](https://fyne.io/), **Duels** is built on Dero's private L1. Powered by [Gnomon](https://github.com/civilware/Gnomon) and [dReams](https://github.com/dReam-dApps/dReams), **Duels** allows Dero users to pit their Dero assets against each other in PvP duels. Modeled after the duels that took place in the days of wild west, **Duels** has a variety of game modes to choose from. The game mechanics are essentially higher/lower, where the outcome is derived on chain.
